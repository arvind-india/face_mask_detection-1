Run real_time_video_capture.py on Rpi to start recording video of pedestrians. 
Gather data that has been generated, move to the videos folder. 
If people are wearing masks in the video, place in the "mask" folder. 
If people are not, place in "no_mask". 
If the video contains examples of people both wearing and not wearing, toss out the video. 
Then, cleanse and process data using video_processing.py 
The data can then be used in the training directory
