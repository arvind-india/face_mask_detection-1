# face_mask_detection
A computer vision based project to track and record if people are wearing masks



# See Write Up At:
The project write up can be found at: https://jonahkaplan1.github.io/pages/mask_cv.html

# Project Requirements
Rasperry Pi (I refer to it as Rpi in the project) with the camera module.
A DSLR, USB webcam, or some sort of secondary camera with better quality. I trigger a DSLR because the image quality is much higher

CV2 both on the Rpi and primary workstation for data training. Keras and other basic python packages (numpy, os, pandas, etc)

Python3 - to be safe, when triggering scripts, I always specified Python3. Example: _python3 video_processing.py_

The code in the training directory highly leverages their work, as well as the models used throughout the project
